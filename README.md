𝒐𝒊𝒃𝒔𝒊𝒑_𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒌𝒏𝒐.6 Weather App with JavaScript

Importing Libraries:
The code begins by importing necessary libraries:
requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
json: Used for handling JSON data.
tkinter (as tk): Used for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI).



API Key and URL:
An API key is stored in the apikey variable. This key is used to authenticate requests to the weather API.
The url variable contains the base URL for the weather API, with the API key appended.
weather Function:
The weather function takes a city name as an argument.
It makes an HTTP request to the weather API using the provided city name.
The response is converted from JSON format to a Python dictionary using json.loads.
The function returns the weather data for the specified city.



display_weather Function:
This function is called when the user clicks the “Get Weather” button in the GUI.
It retrieves the city name entered by the user from the input field (city_entry).
Calls the weather function with the city name to get weather data.
Clears the existing content in the result_text widget (where weather information will be displayed).
Inserts relevant weather information into the result_text widget using result_text.insert.



Creating the GUI:
A basic GUI window is created using tk.Tk().
Labels, entry fields, buttons, and a text widget are added to the GUI using tk.Label, tk.Entry, tk.Button, and tk.Text.
The “Get Weather” button is associated with the display_weather function.
The result_text widget is where weather details will be displayed.




Main Event Loop:
The root.mainloop() call starts the main event loop, which keeps the GUI window open and responsive.
When the user interacts with the GUI (e.g., clicks the button), the associated functions are executed.



User Interaction:
The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the “Get Weather” button.
The display_weather function fetches weather data for that city and displays it in the text widget. this code snippet provides a basic example of how to create a weather app using Python and tkinter.
